Vacation Booking Backend Application

This project is a Java-based backend for a travel agency's vacation booking system, built using the Spring Framework to replace a legacy backend. The backend integrates with a MySQL database and serves data to an existing Angular front-end. Key components include:

Spring Framework & JPA: Used for data persistence, RESTful services, and ORM with MySQL.
Object-Oriented Design: Classes are structured into controllers, services, dao, and entities packages, ensuring modularity and ease of maintenance.

REST API: A RESTful controller allows the Angular front-end to handle customer orders and display vacation packages.
Validation & Design Patterns: Implements data validation for smooth integration with the front-end, using design patterns for maintainable and scalable code.
Features
Customer data management and vacation package checkout via API
Cross-origin support and validation for seamless front-end requests
Sample customer data for testing the database and API functionality

Setup and Run
Clone the project and set up MySQL.
Configure application.properties with your database settings.
Run the application and use the Angular front-end for testing.
Ensure all endpoints are accessible and verify data persistence with MySQL Workbench.

This project highlights the implementation of Java Spring back-end services with practical skills in database integration, API development, and design patterns, making it suitable for professional portfolios.
